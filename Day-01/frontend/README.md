# Color Generator

Color Generator is a simple React + Tailwind CSS application that generates a random HEX color on each button click. The selected color is displayed in a preview box, and users can click the box to instantly copy the HEX code to their clipboard. The project demonstrates dynamic styling in React, use of Tailwind utility classes, and basic state management with useState.
