# Custom Modal

This project demonstrates a reusable modal system built in React using a custom hook (useModal). The modal’s open and close logic is abstracted into the hook, ensuring a clean separation between state management and UI. The modal component is fully reusable and can display any content passed as children, making it scalable for real-world applications such as confirmations, forms, and alerts.
