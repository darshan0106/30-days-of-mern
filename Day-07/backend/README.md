# Global Error Handler

Centralized Error Handling API is a Node.js and Express-based REST API that implements a production-ready error management system using a custom AppError class and a global error-handling middleware. All validation, database, and runtime errors are captured and formatted consistently, enabling clean controller logic and reliable API responses. This project demonstrates how modern backend applications handle operational errors in a scalable and maintainable way.
