# Dark Mode

Dark Mode Toggle is a React-based theme switching system that allows users to toggle between light and dark modes. It uses CSS variables for global theming, React Context for state management, and LocalStorage to persist the user’s preference across sessions. This project demonstrates how to build a scalable, production-ready theming solution commonly used in modern web applications.
