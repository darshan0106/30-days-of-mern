# User relation

This project demonstrates how to implement a One-to-Many relationship in an Express.js backend using MongoDB and Mongoose. A User model is created where each user can have multiple posts, and a Post model references the user’s _id using MongoDB ObjectId. The project includes APIs to create users, create posts for specific users, and fetch posts along with user details using Mongoose’s populate() method. It follows a clean MVC-style structure and showcases real-world backend data modeling practices.
