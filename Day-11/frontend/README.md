# Custom useFetch

This project demonstrates how to fetch and display user data in React using a custom useFetch hook. The custom hook encapsulates API logic, handling loading and error states, which keeps components clean and reusable. By separating data-fetching logic from UI rendering, the project follows best practices for maintainable and scalable React applications. It showcases effective use of React hooks like useState and useEffect to manage asynchronous data flow.
