# Book Management REST API

This project is a RESTful API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB that allows users to create, read, update, and delete books. It supports query-based filtering such as /books?genre=fiction&publishedYear=2020, making it easy to fetch specific records. The API uses Joi for request validation and Mongoose for schema enforcement, following a clean MVC architecture for scalability and maintainability.
