# Debounced Search Bar (React)

This project demonstrates how to build a debounced input field in React using useState and useEffect. The application logs the input value only after the user stops typing for 500ms, preventing unnecessary updates and improving performance. It follows best practices such as controlled inputs, effect cleanup to avoid memory leaks, and safe handling of empty or whitespace-only input.
