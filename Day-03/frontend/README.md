# Accordian Component

This project is a reusable Accordion (FAQ) component built using React. It demonstrates controlled component design by managing accordion open/close state in the parent component and passing it down via props. The accordion supports multiple items being expanded at the same time and follows clean data flow and component separation principles, making it easy to extend, reuse, and maintain.
