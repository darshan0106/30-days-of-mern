# Stop Watch

A simple and efficient stopwatch built using React Hooks. It supports start, stop, reset, and lap functionality while accurately tracking elapsed time in milliseconds. The app leverages useState for state management, useEffect for interval control, and useRef to prevent unnecessary re-renders and memory leaks. This project demonstrates proper timer handling, clean state updates, and core React hook patterns.
