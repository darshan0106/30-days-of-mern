# Express Request Logger Middleware

A simple Express.js application demonstrating a custom global middleware that logs the HTTP method, requested URL, and timestamp for every incoming request. The middleware is registered at the application level, ensuring it runs before all routes and forwards requests using next(). This project highlights core Express middleware concepts and proper request lifecycle handling.
