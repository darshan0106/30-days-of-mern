# Registration Form (Formik + Yup)

This project is a fully validated registration form built using React, Formik, and Yup. It features schema-based form validation, real-time error handling, password matching, and support for multiple input types such as text fields, radio buttons, dropdowns, and checkboxes. The form provides a smooth user experience with proper validation feedback and prevents submission until all rules are satisfied, making it suitable for real-world authentication and onboarding workflows.
